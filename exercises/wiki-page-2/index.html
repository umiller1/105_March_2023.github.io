                Unfortunately, the rules of clean code don't
                work as nicely for inline content. While we'd
                normally want to break code across multiple
                lines (such as the line below), doing so will
                translate those line breaks in the code into
                spaces on the page, which sometimes we don't 
                want. 

                That's why the line below isn't broken across
                multiple lines, because doing so will add
                spaces into the content, which aren't in the
                original page we're trying to reproduce.

            consists in projecting

            Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of 
            <a href="#">design</a><sup>[<a href="#">1</a>]</sup> 
            and of the <a rhef="#">fine arts</a>. Its practice 
            involves <a href="#">creativity</a>, 
            <a href="#">innovation</a> and 
            <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> using manual or 
            <a href="#">digital tools</a>, where it is usual to use text and 
            graphics to communicate visually.

        <p>
            The role of the <a href="#">graphic designer</a> 
            in the communication process is that of encoder 
            or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of 
            visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the 
            <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of 
            <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional 
            arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and 
            imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes 
            beyond what language alone expresses. The design 
            work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand 
            that ends up being established linguistically, 
            either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic 
            design transforms a linguistic message into a 
            graphic 
            manifestation.<sup>[<a href="#">7</a>]</sup>
